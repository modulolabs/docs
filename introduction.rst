Introduction
===========================

Modulo hardware makes it a breeze to assemble the electronics for a project and
we want to make writing software for it as easy as possible too.

Our libraries for Arduino, Python, and Particle do just that. You never have to
worry about pin numbers, registers, or other low level details. Simply create
objects for each Modulo and interact with them in a straightfoward and intuitive
way.

PRE-RELEASE WARNING: This is a pre-release version of the modulo documentation
that does not yet include python API or examples.
